    "__Questions__ are important concepts of the lecture. Answers to Questions should be given in the notebook such that you can upload them together with your implementations to your git repository. If you provide the notebooks before Sunday, June 23rd, you maximize the probability to receive individual feedback about your solutions by our lecture assistants.\n"
