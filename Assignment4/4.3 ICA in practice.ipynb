The singers are surrounded by three microphones while each of those are recording the arriving sound $x_{j}(t)$. Given the observations of the three microphones $x_{j}(t), j=\\{1,2,3\\}$, we now want to compute a reconstruction of the contribution of each singer $s_{i,rec}(t)$ using an ICA model.\n",
